# EditTheVideo-The Web APP
I had created a python code for Converting any <b><i>Mp4 Video to Gray Scale</i></b> in one of my repository [Check Here](https://github.com/manipta/Color2GrayScale.git).

Now I am extending it further to control the <i><b>video playback Speed</b></i> with the same Gray Scale option.
# TRY IT HERE
<b> The web-app is live at [here](https://manipta-steamlitheroku-app-ux4uqk.streamlitapp.com/)</b>
 
<i>Note:</i>I havn't implemented audio with itðŸ™‚.Will implement soon.
